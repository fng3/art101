<h1> Lab 3 File Structures </h1>
<p> The concept of this lab was to learn about local file structures,
	and how to add index.html files. </p>
<h2> Things I Learned </h2>
<p> I learned some things about how the href worked, with linking images,
	as well as the css style sheet to the HTML. </p>
<div class="line"></div>
<h3> Challenges </h3>
<p> One challenge I had was making the CSS work with the HTML.index,
but as I learned how the href works with local file structures, and how it
points towards the local css/site.css file, I understood better how they
function. </p>
<div class="line2"></div>
<h4> Results </h3>
